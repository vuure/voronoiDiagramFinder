# voronoiDiagramFinder
This python code calculates and plots Voronoi Diagram of Origin from 20 points randomly generated under some regulations.

This code wroted under regulations, so some of the libraries and some functions of some libraries not used.

Although there is not any ban for Numpy, I did not used is as i wanted some challange.
